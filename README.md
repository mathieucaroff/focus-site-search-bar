# focus-page-search-bar

When Ctrl+Y is pressed, search for the first search field of the page and focus
it. Cycle between search fields with Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Shift+Y.

Use Ctrl(+Shift)+D as an alternative shortcut.

If the heurstic for matching search fields finds nothing, it matches simple text
inputs. If there are no such text inputs, match any text field.
